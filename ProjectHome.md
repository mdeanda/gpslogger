GPSLogger is a simple Android service that records your GPS location to a SQLite database, and provides a KML export function so the track can be viewed in Google Earth.  Though there are currently a number of Android applications available that track your location, most of them focus on Maps API interaction and sending your location to a subscription site for display on the web.

GPSLogger is primarily designed:
  1. to function without network access--way out in the woods, or up in the air
  1. to not require access to your inbox
  1. to be simple and unobtrusive
